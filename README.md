Dataverse Utilities
===================

Various utilities for interacting with the Dataverse.

Currently, there is only one utility:

* `upload_to_dataverse.py` : Upload a file (or files) to the Dataverse.



Requirements
------------

I'm trying to keep requirements to a minimum, but there are stil a few
that are necessary:

* `requests` : for handling uploads/downloads
* `python-magic` : for determining MIME types of files
